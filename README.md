Cheat Engine is an open source mmemory scanner, debugger Originally created by Eric Heijnen who also goes by the name DarkByte. Cheat Engine is created in Pascal, you would need to use Lazarus latest in order to compile this program, and also utilizes lua for its scripting. Cheat Engine is useful in many ways. Its searching, and programming makes cheat engine a useful program to enjoy working with Assembly. An Individual can easily use cheat engine in order to manipulate a game to do what they want. As someone who also owns artmoney, use ollydbg, worked with softice, IDA and also currently uses windbg and x64dbg. I can say without a doubt that Cheat Engine is on its own level. With a large Open source community, Cheat Engine is by far one of the best for messing with games.
